[Machine learning model validation](machine-learning-model-validation.md)

The use of machine learning models quickly expands to business areas with strong regulation, such as finance and medicine. Machine learning models and their validation differ substantially from classical models and classical model validation. Regulators, model validation teams and model developers need to adjust to different requirements on model validation and model development.

These notes aim to go into detail what topics model validation of machine learning models should address.

[Ask questions to your PDF documents - a tutorial](Ask%20questions%20to%20your%20PDF%20documents%20-%20a%20tutorial.ipynb)

In this notebook, we use a large language model to ask and answer questions to PDF documents. You may want to do this with non-publically available documents, or with documents that appeared after the language model was trained.

Additionally, we want to do run the language model locally. This has advantages for privacy and confidentiality (if you cannot send your data to a remote service).

We will use Llama 7B as the language model, and langchain for integration of the other necessary pieces.
