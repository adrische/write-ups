# Data science mentorship program

I recently organized a data science mentorship program at my organization. I realized there are lots of resources available on career mentoring, some of which are applicable to technical skills mentoring, but not all. I did find a few resources specifically related to data science mentoring, but there do not seem to be too many resources available yet, which is why I'm sharing my experiences here.

The article follows the structure of the program, with a focus on how I approached each step, and what could be done differently next time.

## Background and motivation for the program

My thoughts when designing the program were that it should complement other already available learning & development programs within the company, both in terms of content and in terms of intensity. 

Other available programs were mainly: Rotations in other departments, mentorship programs focused on career development, technical training focused on certain skills, as well as self-study. Rotations in other departments would typically be up to a few months with medium to full intensity, while technical training would typically last one week.

As a consequence, I decided that the mentorship program should be structured around a concrete project, and that it should be low intensity over a medium to long period of time. I indicated that mentees should invest on average 4 hours per week, while mentors should allocate up to 2 hours per week, over about 3 months. I explicitly excluded the career-related aspect from the program. This approach generally resonated well with the participants.

## Outreach to find mentors and mentees

The mentorship program and call for mentors was advertised through top-down communication via management. Additionally I did my own outreach and networking to find potentially interested mentors.

After having found some mentors, I met them individually to get to know them, asking them who else could be interested, but also to collect photos and information for a profile for an announcement post.

Then I announced the program and call for mentees through internal forums.

Both mentors and mentees needed to confirm their time availability and some general mentor and mentee behavioral best practices.

Initially, there were 5 mentors and 8 mentees.

I was quite happy that the initial number of participants was rather small so I could get to know most of them personally.

Despite the initial time commitment, there were a few instances where either a mentee or mentor needed to deprioritize work on the mentorship program due to other priorities. It could be considered to make the confirmation of time availability more formal, for example by involving the line managers of the participants.

All participants should be comfortable with a common language.

## Matching

The mentor-mentee matching was based on a kick-off meeting during which there was time (7 minutes) for all pairs of mentees and mentors to meet personally and have an open discussion (a "speed dating" approach).

Afterwards I collected their preferred match in the form of a ranking and did a manual matching. I wasn't sure what metric to optimize, but decided to optimize each individual match, rather than an overall average metric, and to give more weight to first or second preferences. 

I did not base the matching on a skills self-assessment. I saw the risk that such a self-assessment could potentially be too subjective to base the matching on. Also, for a good match it was not clear to me what skill level the mentor should have compared to the mentee. The mentor can supplement with other skills and rely on support from others for a given skill that is lacking. 

I matched 5 mentors with 6 mentees. Two mentees could not be matched. For one mentee this appeared not to be a problem due to other tasks having come up in the meantime, but the other mentee was not happy with this outcome. I tried to provide both with additional learning resources.

Overall, all matched pairs of mentees and mentors were very happy with their respective match.

To prevent mentees from not being matched, you should have mentors before you start to accept applications of mentees, and then only accept as many applications of mentees as the mentors have capacity, not more. If you receive fewer than expected applications from mentees, not every mentor will be assigned a mentee, but this risk can be communicated in advance.

Having the possibility of mentees and mentors to meet each other personally has the advantage of assessing the personal fit of the mentee and mentor. 

An unanimous feedback was that 7 minutes for the initial mentee \- mentor "speed dating" discussion was not enough. 

## Project phase

I announced the matching and the start of the working phase. I gave very little guidance on how to proceed during this phase. In particular, at the start of this stage no projects were agreed upon yet. I encouraged weekly mentee-mentor meetings and gave a rough indication on how much time per week they should spend on average. I distributed some high-level support materials on how to structure this phase (e.g., how to make "SMART" project goals, what are the stages of a typical data science project).

There was an intermediary check-in meeting with everyone and further individual follow-ups more towards the end of the program to ask if all was going well. I kept track of participation during these check-in meetings and followed up afterwards with those that could not participate.

I received the feedback that there was too little guidance on how to find projects, and on how to structure the overall time until the end of the program.

In my case, there was a natural pre-selection of the area from which projects to pick (pricing within insurance). Guidance on choosing a particular project could involve criteria like interests of mentee and mentor, data availability, business relevance, and project feasibility. 

Any project will not only require learning the technical details, but will potentially also involve the need to better understand the corresponding business aspect, how the organization is structured, and there will also be some time before mentee and mentor can work productively with each other. Therefore, it's probably better to have a more narrowly defined project in the beginning and only then become more ambitious.

Some guidance on how to structure the time until the end of the program could be: 

1. 1 month for project scoping, checking data availability, project feasibility, and business relevance;   
2. the actual project work;   
3. 2 weeks to clean up and prepare the final presentation.

## Conclusion of program

The program ended with a final presentation. Each mentee presented their project, and both mentee and mentor commented on how they perceived the program and what their key learnings and challenges were. I didn't want to overburden the mentees with creating a presentation rather than focussing on the actual project, so the presentation could be very informal. 

Every participant of the program was attending, together with two more senior sponsors from the organization.

After the final presentation, I shared certificates, and created an internal folder to share the final presentations.

Going forward, we will build a repository of past projects as examples and the participants of this cohort will be the basis for a network of subject matter experts to which the participants of future editions of this mentorship program can reach out to.

The main purpose of the final presentations was that mentees (and also mentors) could reflect on their learning progress. It is also possible to consider making participation in the final presentations available to a larger internal audience. This should be weighted against the potential additional time required to prepare a more polished presentation.

## Other

In advance of the program, I talked to a few people interested in being a mentee who already had very concrete business-relevant project ideas and knew what techniques they wanted to try. I told them they seem advanced enough so they would not necessarily need mentoring support. Rather, I suggested that they try to get buy-in from their line manager so they would be able to work on their project as part of their regular work.

Meetings with many participants should be set up well in advance (at least one month, preferably more), as it may be difficult to find a free slot. To respect time zones, you may need two meetings to reach everybody.

The overall organization of the program took much longer than expected. Initially, I targeted around 3 months for the project work. It turned out that from kick-off to post-finalization activities around 7 months passed, of which the project work spanned 4 months. From the initial outreach to find mentors, to the announcement of the matching outcome, 2 months passed. To have two editions of the program per year, part of the organization of the next cohort (e.g., announcement) would need to overlap with the still ongoing edition.

## Personal perspective

Overall, it was a pretty good experience, I really enjoyed the organization and it was a personal and professional highlight. It made me quite happy to enable interactions between people who would otherwise not have met, and to help facilitate projects that would not have happened otherwise.

From an organizational perspective, it's quite impressive what you can achieve. In total, it was quite a lot of work, but it was spread across the entire time of the program (+ before and after), so it was manageable.

Another positive highlight was that everyone I talked to was very supportive. I asked many people for advice (e.g., organizers of other learning & development programs, experienced technical people / line managers, etc.) and they were all happy to help.
